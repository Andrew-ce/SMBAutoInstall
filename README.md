# SMBAutoInstall
SMBAutoInstall contains the files necessary to create a simple stand alone SMB shared directory on a local network. This was created for fresh installs on Debian systems. Any changes to SMB share users and directories must be made in the smb.conf and install_debian_smb.sh before running.
